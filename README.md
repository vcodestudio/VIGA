# AgenticVerifier

MCP-based agent library for dual-agent (Generator/Verifier) interactive frameworks, supporting 3D (Blender), 2D (PPTX), and Design2Code (HTML/CSS) modes. Plug and play for automated code generation, execution, and verification workflows.

## Quick Start

### Environment

Since mcp-framework can decouple agents and tools, we highly recommend you to create different envs to run the framework.

The official envs names are `[agent, blender, pptx, chrome]` for agent, exec_blender, exec_slides, exec_html. You can found the requirement under `requirements/`

For blender, you need to further install executable `blender` and `infinigen` in the system:

```zsh
cd utils
git clone https://github.com/princeton-vl/infinigen.git
bash scripts/install/interactive_blender.sh
```

For slide, you need to further install `unoconv` in the system:

```zsh
sudo apt install -y libreoffice unoconv
# To verify the installation, run
/usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/unoconv --version
```
