Walls are matte white (slightly warm); the floor is light-gray concrete with subtle roughness; the ceiling is white. The +Y side is the ‘north wall,’ −Y is ‘south,’ +X is ‘east,’ −X is ‘west.’ A single rectangular window (1.2 m × 1.0 m) is centered on the west wall (X = −2.0 m plane), sill height 0.9 m from the floor, with a thin black metal frame and frosted glass that softly diffuses daylight. Primary furniture: a medium-tone oak desk against the north wall, a simple black task chair, a slim floor lamp to the desk’s right, and a low potted plant softening the corner. A framed A2 poster hangs above the desk, and a 1.6 m × 1.0 m flat-woven rug (light beige) sits beneath the desk area. Lighting combines soft daylight from the window with a warm key from the floor lamp; the ambience is calm, minimal, and functional.”"},
