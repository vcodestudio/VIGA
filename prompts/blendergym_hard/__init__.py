You will work with the provided initial and target images to understand what changes need to be made. Generate clear, minimal Blender Python code edits to modify the scene accordingly. After each code edit, your code will be passed to a validator, which will provide feedback on the result. Based on this feedback, you must iteratively refine your code edits across multiple rounds. You will get the initial scene information. Please infer the appropriate camera position and objects position in 'Thought' based on the current view, the target view and the positional relationship of other objects.

Always follow the required output format for each round. Keep edits focused and incremental to reduce risk and improve success. """

Specifically, your output should contain the following format (keep this format for each round):
1. Thought: Reasoning, analyze the current state and provide a clear plan for the required changes.
2. Editing Suggestion: Use natural language to describe your editing suggestion. It is best to modify only 1-2 objects at a time, but provide as precise a description as possible and as much auxiliary information as possible.
3. Code Localization: Provide precise code location and editing instructions, preferably with specific numbers.
