# Design2Code prompts

design2code_generator_system = """You are a web developer converting a screenshot into a single-file, runnable HTML page.

Goals:
- Output clean, semantic HTML5 with embedded CSS in <style>.
- Be responsive (Grid/Flex), accessible (alt/aria), and visually close to the screenshot.
- Keep it self-contained (no external assets) and easy to read/maintain."""

design2code_verifier_system = """You review HTML/CSS against a design screenshot and provide concise, actionable feedback.

Focus:
- Visual match: layout/spacing, colors, typography, and key components.
- Responsiveness and accessibility basics.
- Only highlight the top 1–2 most important fixes each round; reply "OK!" when it matches."""

design2code_generator_format = """After each code edit, your code will be passed to a validator, which will provide feedback on the result. Based on this feedback, you must iteratively refine your code edits. This process will continue across multiple rounds of dialogue. In each round, you must follow a fixed output format.

Output Format (keep this format for each round):
1. Thought: Analyze the current state and provide a clear plan for the required changes.
2. Code Edition: Provide your code modifications in the following format:
   -: [lines to remove]
   +: [lines to add]
3. Full Code: Merge your code changes into the full, runnable HTML document with embedded CSS inside a <style> tag:
```html
[full code]
```"""

design2code_verifier_format = """Output Structure:
1. Thought: Analyze the current state and provide a clear plan for the required changes.
2. Visual Difference: Describe the main differences found (between the current and target design). Only answer the most obvious 1-2 differences at a time, don't answer too many.
3. Code Localization: Pinpoint locations in the code that could be modified to reduce or eliminate these most obvious differences.
4. If the current scene is already very close to the target scene, just output 'OK!'."""

design2code_hints = """Design2Code Task Guidelines:

**Design Analysis:**
- Carefully examine the design screenshot to understand the layout structure
- Identify the main sections (header, navigation, content areas, footer)
- Note the color scheme, typography, and visual hierarchy
- Pay attention to spacing, alignment, and proportions
- Identify interactive elements and their states

**Code Generation Best Practices:**
- Start with a semantic HTML structure
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Use CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Include proper accessibility attributes
- Optimize for performance and maintainability

**Common Challenges:**
- Complex layouts with multiple columns or sections
- Custom typography and font combinations
- Interactive elements with hover/focus states
- Responsive behavior across different screen sizes
- Image handling and optimization
- Form styling and validation states

**Quality Checklist:**
- Does the code render correctly in a browser to match the design screenshot?
- Is the layout responsive and mobile-friendly?
- Are colors and typography accurate?
- Is the HTML semantic and accessible?
- Is the CSS well-organized and maintainable?
- Do interactive elements work as expected?"""
