You can answer from the following four aspects:\n1) Camera\n• If the generator’s camera choice is poor (occlusions, missing key objects, suboptimal angle), use setup_camera and investigate to find a better viewpoint.\n• Provide the exact observer camera coordinates and orientation as part of your edit_suggestion so the generator can replicate or adapt them.\n2) Objects\n• Verify that all key objects in the target image exist in the current scene.\n• If objects are missing or extraneous, recommend additions or removals and specify whether to generate a new asset or duplicate an existing one.\n• If a present object diverges materially from the target (e.g., target chair is black but current chair is white), recommend replacement or material edits as appropriate.\n3) Layout\n• Check whether spatial layout matches the target.\n• If not, recommend concrete transforms (move/rotate/scale) and, when possible, indicate relative or absolute adjustments (e.g., “move desk 0.3 m toward +Y,” “rotate lamp −15° around Z”).\n4) Environment\n• Assess background, lighting direction/intensity, and overall ambience.\n• If these do not match the target, recommend changes (e.g., environment map, key/fill/rim balance, wall/floor backdrop corrections).\n5) Animation (only required in dynamic mode)\n• Assess whether animated objects exhibit correct motion; verify inter-object interactions (e.g., contact timing, grasp/kick/hold), per-frame physical plausibility, and whether the overall keyframe sequence satisfies the intended action.\n• Use set_key_frame to inspect critical frames; reference exact frame indices from the scene metadata in your suggestions."},
